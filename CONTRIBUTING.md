## Did you find a defect / bug?

1. Search [issues](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
   to ensure that the bug is not already known.  Be sure to include solved issues
   in your search as it could already be fixed but not yet released.
2. If you do not see any matching issue, please create a
   [new issue](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues/new/choose).
   Please include as much detail as possible so that others can 
   recreate the issue.


Please note that the Joulescope UI uses the following other projects
that are managed by the same team:

* [joulescope_driver](https://github.com/jetperch/joulescope_driver)
* [jls](https://github.com/jetperch/jls)

If you know your issue applies to one of these other projects, please 
search their issues and create the issue directly in that project.

If you don't know where the issue lies, don't worry!  Create an issue
here, and we'll figure it out.


## Did you fix a defect / bug?

Thank you!

1. If an issue does not already exist, please create one.
2. Clone the GitHub repo and create your fix.  Please be sure to
   add an entry to the CHANGELOG!
3. Open a new GitHub pull request (PR) with the fix.
   Make sure that the PR references the issue number.
4. Wait for review.  We try our best to respond to new PR's
   within 1 business day.  Most of the team observes USA holidays.
   Assuming everything looks good, it will be merged into "main"
   and be present in the next official release.


## Do you want to add a feature or change a feature?

The first step is to discuss your 
idea with the community.  The best place for feature discussion is over 
on the [Joulescope forum](https://forum.joulescope.com/).
The core development team monitors the forum
and usually responds within 1 business day.  

Once we refine the feature and agree on an implementation, 
the next step is to plan execution.
Please be aware that we are a small team, and we need to 
carefully assign and manage priorities to the benefit of the 
entire community.  Even great features may be put on the backlog
if it requires core team effort.

If you are planning to implement the feature at this point, great!
Create an issue for the new feature and
follow the same process as fixing a defect above.

If you want the community to implement the feature, that works, too.
We may decide to create an issue or assign it to our privately
managed backlog.
